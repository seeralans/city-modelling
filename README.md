#City Modelling 

###Using the 2011 UK census data can we formulate an emprical modells that identify cities and areas within cities?

The aims of the project are:
- Develop automated methods of finding the boundary of a city.
- Design metrics that quantify how "good" a boundary is.
- Identify parameters that differenciate city ouput areas to non-city output
	areas.
- Identify the different catogories of output areas.
- Find a method to identify the number of different catergories needed for
	different scenarios.
- Identify and compare parameters that subdivide the city to the parameters
	that are used for the clasification of a city.
